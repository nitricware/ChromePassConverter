# ChromePassConverter

## Introduction

ChromePassConverter converts an XML file created with ChromePass from NirSoft to an XML file that is readable by Password Exporter for Firefox.

## Requirements

Besides Chrome, Firefox, Password Exporter and ChromePass you need *PHP 5*.

## Usage

1. Edit the variable ```$passFile``` in ```converter.php``` to match the path to the XML file that was created by ChromePass or name the XML file that was created by ChromePass ```pass.xml```.
2. Run ```converter.php```
3. Copy the output to a new file (i.e. ```firefoxPasses.xml```)
