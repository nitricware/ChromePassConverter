# ChromePassConverter

## Introduction

ChromePassConverter converts an XML file created with ChromePass from NirSoft to an XML file that is readable by Password Exporter for Firefox.

## Requirements

Besides Chrome, Firefox, Password Exporter and ChromePass (only available for Windows) you need **PHP 5** or Python 2.

## Usage

### PHP

1. Edit the variable ```$passFile``` in ```converter.php``` to match the path to the XML file that was created by ChromePass or name the XML file that was created by ChromePass ```pass.xml``` and put it in the same directory.
2. Modify the options
3. Run ```converter.php```
4. Copy the output to a new file (i.e. ```firefoxPasses.xml```) with a text editor of your choice.

### Python

1. Edit the variable ```passFile``` in ```converter.py``` to match the path to the XML file that was created by ChromePass.
2. Modify the options
3. Run ```converter.py```
4. Copy the output to a new file (i.e. ```firefoxPasses.xml```) with a text editor of your choice or pick up the file this converter created.
